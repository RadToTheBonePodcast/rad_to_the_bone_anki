Because medulloblastomas are midline, they can often obstruct CSF flow in the region of the 4th ventricle, and cause hydrocephalus.
The next most common posterior fossa brain tumor in children, are pilocytic astrocytomas.
Pilocytic astrocytomas, are typically located in a single cerebellar hemisphere, and are often cystic with an enhancing mural nodule.

This next one will be a long and detailed answer.
What are the typical MR features of a hemangioblastoma?
What differentials must be considered?",,,,"Hemangioblastomas typically appear either as a cyst with a mural nodule or as a completely solid enhancing mass.
They often have vascular flow voids within or at the periphery of the lesion.
Hemangioblastomas do not demonstrate diffusion restriction.
The imaging features of a cyst with a mural nodule is the typical appearance, and occur in about 60% of cases.
A solid-enhancing mass is the other variant and occurs around 40% of the time.
The differentials of these masses depend on the overall appearance.
If the posterior fossa mass is cystic with a mural nodule, then a pilocytic astrocytoma can be considered.
However, pilocytic astrocytomas are more commonly seen in children and young adults.
The nodule enhancement is less intense and more heterogeneous in pilocytic astrocytomas, compared to hemangioblastomas.
Metastatic lesions can also be considered if there is a cyst and a mural nodule in the posterior fossa of an adult.
The metastatic lesions that typically have this appearance are melanoma and renal cell carcinoma.
The apparent cyst is often due to necrosis, rather than a true cyst.
An abscess could also be cystic in the posterior fossa.
However, an abscess will show diffusion restriction due to the debris within it.
This is a key feature, because hemangioblastomas do not restrict diffusion.
Gangliogliomas can sometimes appear cystic with a mural nodule. However, these are typically supratentorial.
These are all the differentials of a posterior fossa cyst with a mural nodule.
Now we will discuss the differential diagnoses of a solid enhancing posterior fossa mass, including: hemangioblastomas, meningiomas, metastatic lesions, and paragangliomas.
A meningioma is an extra-axial enhancing mass with a characteristic dural tail and is often found in the region of the cerebellopontine angle.
Metastatic lesions are the most common brain lesions in the posterior fossa of an adult.
In cases where there's a single solid enhancing mass, it may be challenging to differentiate between a hemangioblastoma and a solitary hypervascular metastatic lesion.
The typical hypervascular metastatic lesions are renal cell carcinomas, thyroid cancers, and melanomas.
Paragangliomas can also appear as a solid enhancing mass in the posterior fossa, but are typically in the region of the jugular foramen, and will have a heterogeneous salt-and-pepper appearance.",,,,Neuroradiology,Brain,brain neoplasms,TRUE,TRUE,11

Non-ionic iodinated contrast on-the-other-hand, is typically used today.
It is covalently bound, and does not dissociate, making it much more stable, and less likely to cause hypersensitivity reactions.

Where a ""GRE sequence"" only contains the 90-degree excitation pulse and no refocusing pulse.
Let me explain in more detail.
Elemental materials such as iron and calcium, along with air-to-bone interfaces, cause small local magnetic changes which cause varying precession rates of nearby tissues.
Any varying precession-rate from the uniform precession frequency, determined by B-0 causes a loss of signal.
Which is precisely what you want when looking for blood with a GRE sequence.
A T2 sequence will add a 180-degree refocusing pulse, essentially flipping the precession rates, so a precession rate that was previously slower is now faster, and a precession rate that was previously faster is now slower, effectively evening out the precession rate and eliminating signal loss, making a beautiful T2-weighted image.
In summary, a T2 sequence contains the 90-degree excitation pulse followed by a 180-refocusing pulse, which corrects for the local magnetic field inhomogeneities caused by iron, calcium and air.

",,,,"Truncation artifact occurs when k-space is incompletely sampled, particularly the peripheral high-spatial-frequency data due to a limited matrix size or reduced phase-encoding steps, resulting in oscillations near sharp tissue interfaces.
The primary method to mitigate this artifact is acquiring more k-space data, most effectively by increasing the matrix size, especially in the phase-encoding direction, or when partial Fourier is used, by increasing the fraction of phase-encoding k-space that is acquired.
Secondary methods act on already acquired data and include apodization and zero-filling interpolation.
Adopization users a filter or kernel, which reduces ringing artifact by smoothing edge transitions at the expense of mild spatial resolution loss.
Zero-filling interpolation smooths the image appearance without increasing true resolution. These secondary methods are less effective at mitigating the truncation artifact compared to increasing phase-encoding data acquisition.",,,,Physics,MR physics,MR physics,,TRUE,314

FALSE,What are the typical MR features of a spinal meningioma?,,,,"Meningiomas are typically isointense to the spinal on T1 and T2WI.
There is avid enhancement.
There is attachment to the dura, and there is often a visable dural tail.
Only some spinal meningiomas will have calcifications, however, it atypical for any other intradural spinal lesion to have calcifications so this can be a specific feature for meningiomas when present.
Meningiomas tend to cause hyperostosis and sclerosis of adjacent bon, compared to nerve sheath tumors which cause remodeling and erosion.
